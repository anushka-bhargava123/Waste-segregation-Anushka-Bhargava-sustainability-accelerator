        <center><h3>Textile waste is covering 7% of the landfills in the present generation</h3></center>

     <center><p><b><u>WASTE-RELATED TO MY PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></u></p></center>
        <p><b>Researchers found that an item of clothing usually lasts between 100-200 years,</b> however only a small amount of clothing gets that amount of use. On average, people buy 50 new pieces of clothing each year, yet some pieces will only be worn a handful of times. We need to curb our desire to spend and get the most use out of the existing clothes we have.</p>
        <p><i><b>Non-technological ways-> </i></b></p>
        <p><ol><li>Donation of clothes.</li>
           <li>Making pulp of the extra textile waste and then discard.</li>
           <li>Upcycle your clothing.</li>
           <li>Buy clothes made out of eco-friendly material.</li>
           <li>Increase the number of times you wear the clothes.</li></p>
        </ol>
           <p><i><b>Cheaper ways-></i></b></p>
        </ol>
        <p><ol><li>Make a pulp out of the retired clothes and process it to make paper based folders, diaries etc.</li>
        <li>Use the cuttings and pieces from old clothes and design fresh designs and sell them.</li>
        <li>Design accessories out of discarded clothes such as purses, laptop sleeves, tote bags, jholas, phone covers etc.</li>
        <li>Use less resource-intensive but eco-friendly raw materials such as polyester etc.</li></p>
        </ol>
            <p><i><b>Expensive ways-></b></i></p>
            <p><ol><li>Set up a factory that recycles the discarded clothes and redesigns them into couture. This would engage inputs from designers and other related infrastructure and resources.</li>
            <li> A pulp-making plant from the clothes that are no longer needed and supply that pulp to various other vendors who recycle that pulp for useful products.</li>
            <li>We can research about the use of discarded clothes in making brocks and mortar for laying of roads. A plant can be set up for preparing that.</li>
            <li> A start-up ( with a seed fund of more than 1,00,00,000 INR) for recycling and reusing the discarded clothes into carpets, furnishing materials etc.</li>
            <li> A start-up to create eccentric jholas and cloth bags ( in the shape of a shirt/ trousers/ sleeves/ shoes etc.) for daily usage from discarded clothes.</li></p>
            </ol>
                <p><i><b>Technological ways-></b></i></p>
                <p><ol><li> IoT based technology to recycle the unused and discarded clothes into brick and mortar. These bricks and mortar can be used in construction materials.</li>
                <li> A website can be set up to ease the recycling of used clothes and other materials.</li>
                <li>IoT based technology to monitor the consumption of resources such as water, manure and fertilizers etc. by the crops used as raw materials for textiles.</li>
                <li>An application should be developed for communities to access platforms to donate unused or old clothes, buy & sell recycled items, register themselves as sustainability agents and provide suggestions etc.</li>
                <li> An application/website to offer internships to students and larger communities (on incentive basis) for creating awareness and mobility in the field of textile disposal problems and usage of recycled materials and items.</li></p>
